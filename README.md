# Project-Flow-Manager
Project Flow Manager is an effective project management tool designed to optimize workflows and boost efficiency. It offers a comprehensive feature set for managing projects efficiently. With its flexible yet structured framework, Project Flow Manager simplifies project and task management, ensuring smooth coordination and timely completion.<br>
<br>

In Project Flow Manager, projects are organized into categories, allowing users to create projects within a specific category based on their requirements. The user who creates a project is designated as the Project Leader. Projects can be set as either public or private:

    * Public projects are visible to all users, encouraging open collaboration and easy access for anyone within the platform.
    * Private projects are restricted to the Project Leader and designated participants, ensuring confidentiality.

The Project Leader is responsible for managing project participants, with the ability to invite or remove members, ensuring that only the appropriate team members are included.

In addition, the Project Leader can create and assign tasks to participants, with each task assigned to a specific user who is responsible for completing it by the given deadline.
Tasks within a project can also be categorized as public or private:

    * Public tasks are visible to all project participants, encouraging accountability and collaboration.
    * Private tasks are visible only to the Project Leader and the assigned user, ensuring focus and privacy for sensitive assignments.

Task-assigned users can interact with the task by providing updates, such as marking it as complete or sending a response message to the Project Leader. 
The Project Leader maintains full control over the project and its tasks, with the ability to update or delete them as needed.
